<h1>Simplifide</h1>

<p>Simplifide was an commercial eclipse plugin for hardware languages. Development was discontinued on it a couple of years ago and over time the web site
    as well as the update site became non functional. It has now been open sourced and ported to github to hopefully allow for its continued usage. Unfortunately
    much of the information from the Simplifide website could not be recovered but the update site and some unformatted documentation is shown below. Information
    regarding this plugin will be added in the near future.
